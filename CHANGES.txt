stratis-cli 1.0.5 (UNRELEASED)
==============================
Python auto-formatter: black (18.9b0)

New dependency requirements:
  - dbus-python-client-gen: 0.6

- Add a STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT environment variable:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/252
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/345

- Fix a bug where stratis exited with 0 exit code and printed usage to
  standard output in some situations where a command could not be parsed.
  Now print usage message to standard error and exit with code 2:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/248
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/332

- Simplify reporting of errors. If the error has no explanation,
  allow the exception to propagate, otherwise just print the
  explanation. This does not affect any behavior when the --propagate
  flag is set:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/274

- Add an explanation for the error that occurs when the D-Bus times out
  before the daemon responds:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/336
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/347

- Make bash completion aware of --propagate flag:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/pull/300

- Defer loading of _data.py module until the command-line has been parsed.
  This should have no visible effect:
